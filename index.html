    <div class="section">
      <div class="text"><p class="story"><em> Born March 22, 2013 - Adopted June 23rd, 2013</em><br> <div class="paragraph"> When I was living in Seattle, WA I decided to adopt a dog. It was terrible timing - it was the summer before my senior year of college, I was a full-time student, and had full time job. One afternoon
      I was in bed browsing Craigslist when I came upon an ad that was trying to promote the adoption of six great dane mix puppies. I saw this puppy, Chorizo, and I fell in love. I emailed the shelter, but unfortunately, Chorizo had already been adopted.
      On the bright side, Chorizo's sibling, Bologna, was still available! I filled out the adoption application and went through the interview process. It took six hours to drive up to Republic, WA where the shelter was located, but it was worth it in
      the end. Upon arriving at the shelter I sat down on the ground, Bologna walked right up to me and fell asleep in my lap immeditately. It was love at first nap! I couldn't take him home that day, but on the way home I decided he shall be called Apollo
      (after the Battlestar Galactica character,duh).</div> </p></div>

    <h3 class="header">The Diagnosis</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text"><p class="story"><em> Boy, was Apollo a handful as a puppy!</em><br> <div class="paragraph"> He was extremely hyper-active, intelligent, afraid of stairs, loved sleeping on my tempurpedic pillow, and was crazy for hikes. After college, I moved to Southern California. Apollo got to meet my family and his (kind
      of) dog siblings. He experienced some crazy hiking trails (some of which neither of us enjoyed) and got to go to several dog beaches! After a year in the sunshine state, I got a promotion through work and relocated to NYC. After a few months living there,
      I noticed something was wrong with Apollo, so I took him to the vet. After several different vets and opinions, it turns out Apollo has an auto-immune disease called Perianal Fistulas. It's not lethal, but there also is no cure. As long as I keep
      him on a very strict diet, he should live a somewhat normal life.</div></p></div>

    <h3 class="header"> What is he up to now?</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="text"><p class="story"> <em>Currently, Apollo and I reside in Brooklyn.</em><br> <div class="paragraph"> He is more prone to minor health issues, so he does spend more time than usual in "the cone of shame", but it does not break his spirit! He is friendly, loves to make new human and animal friends, and
        one day he will get revenge on the squirrel that taunts him in the backyard! His favorite past times include going on walks around the park, humping his dog bffl Mo, and being the little spoon during cuddle sessions (he's still all about that tempurpedic
        pillow)!</div></p></div>
